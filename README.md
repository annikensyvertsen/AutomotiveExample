# AutomotiveExample
This is a very simlpified code example with a basic Android Automotive setup for an application with the POI category.
If you want to change the category of the application, this can be done in the AndroidManifest.xml file, just search for "POI" and replace it with the cateogry you want.


## Prerequisites

### Android Studio
Make sure you have the correct version of Android Studio (not Android Studio preview) downloaded
I used Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch (6th December 2022)

You can check what version you have by clicking “Android Studio” -> About Android Studio 

### Google Account
You also need to have a Google Account so that you can sign in on Google Play store in the emulator and download the app/update the system etc.
